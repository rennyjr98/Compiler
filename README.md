# 🧠 Compiler

A simple compiler built from scratch as part of a school project.  
This compiler takes source code written in a custom language, processes it through lexical and syntactic analysis, and generates output code — demonstrating the core concepts of **compiler design**.

---

## 🚀 What Is This?

This project is a **fully functional compiler** created for an academic course in compilers and language processing.  
It illustrates essential compiler stages:

✔ Lexical analysis (tokenization)  
✔ Syntax analysis (parsing)  
✔ Semantic checks  
✔ Code generation / intermediate representation

By building this from scratch, you get hands-on experience with how programming languages are translated into executable logic.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Compilers are at the heart of all programming languages.  
Understanding how they work improves your knowledge of:

- Language design
- Automata and grammars
- Parsing techniques
- Code generation
- Error handling

This project demonstrates those concepts in a compact, readable structure.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

✔ **Java** or **Your Language Runtime** (if applicable)  
✔ **Build tool** (Maven, Gradle, or equivalent)  
✔ **Compiler course knowledge** (recommended)

---

## ▶️ Running the Compiler

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rennyjr98/Compiler.git
```

## 🧩 How It Works

### 1. Lexical Analysis

The scanner reads the text and converts it into tokens — identifiers, keywords, symbols, literals.

### 2. Syntactic Analysis

The parser checks tokens against grammar rules and builds a syntax tree.

### 3. Semantic Checks

Ensures correct usage of variables, types, and constructs.
